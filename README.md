sonify_shots
============

SuperCollider program to take timing of shots from a film and assign notes to each cut. 

In this case, it takes a CSV of shot times for The Shining, and outputs it with a sound of your choice at each cut. This is usually sped up to get a quick sense of shot timing in a film, or just to make music.
